  		<h1>The Sound of Silence</h1>
  		<h2> by <i>Disturbed</i></h2>
  		<p>Hello darkness, my old friend<br>
		I've come to talk with you again<br>
		Because a vision softly creeping<br>
		Left its seeds while I was sleeping<br>
		And the vision that was planted in my brain<br>
		Still remains<br>
		Within the sound of silence<br>
		</p>
		<p>
		In restless dreams, I walked alone<br>
		Narrow streets of cobblestone<br>
		'Neath the halo of a street lamp<br>
		I turned my collar to the cold and damp<br>
		When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light<br>
		That split the night<br>
		And touched the sound of silence<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		And in the naked light, I saw<br>
		Ten thousand people, maybe more<br>
		People talking without speaking<br>
		People hearing without listening<br>
		People writing songs that voices never shared<br>
		And no one dared<br>
		Disturb the sound of silence<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		"Fools" said I, "You do not know<br>
		Silence like a cancer grows<br>
		Hear my words that I might teach you<br>
		Take my arms that I might reach you"<br>
		But my words, like silent raindrops fell<br>
		And echoed in the wells of silence<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		And the people bowed and prayed<br>
		To the neon god they made<br>
		And the sign flashed out its warning<br>
		In the words that it was forming<br>
		Then the sign said, "The words on the prophets<br>
		are written on the subway walls<br>
		In tenement halls"<br>
		And whispered in the sound of silence
	</p>
